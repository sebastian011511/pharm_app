# pharm_app


This app is a collaboration between our Android Development class and our school's nursing program.  We developed an app with the top 200 drugs of the year.  The app was created by previous teams but we updated and improved the app.

In the app you can do the following:

1. View list of drugs.  Select a drug and you are able to review drugs, information and hear the pronunciation of the generic and brand name.
2. Take a quiz and test your skills.  Choose topic, study field, number of questions, name the quiz, and take a series of multiple choice questions.
3. Review the quizzes you have taken and retake the quiz.
4. Filter list of drugs by selecting the topic.
5. Reorganize the order of the drugs
6. About the app and its authors
7. Legal stuff for school
